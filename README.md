EVENTRA app was developed for the University of Kelaniya to notify events to the event enthusiasts within the university. The university has assigned one person to collect event details from the event organizers. This designated individual has only one username and a password, as follows:

    # Username: admin
    # Password: 1234

The purpose of this app is to allow event enthusiasts to receive alerts about every event taking place on the university premises.

Please use the provided username and password to log in and access the app.

Thank you for using EVENTRA!
